PHP Grapple

A Code Parser written in PHP that uses regex to analyze source code.

Currently, PHP Grapple's main focus is PHP Code Parsing but support other languages
will be added in future versions.  Next up, Javascript, maybe followed by Python.

Unit Testing is done with PHPUnit, to run tests...

    cd tests
    phpunit
